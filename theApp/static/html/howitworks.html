	  If you're not a pathologist, you have a 50/50 chance of correctly identifying which of the two images above
	  contains metastatic tissue -- the same probability
	  that an untrained computer could correctly classify the two types of tissue.
	  The image on the left is healthy tissue, and the other is metastatic tissue.
	  How would you classify this other image to the right?  It has a similar color and structure to the tissue
	  that you learned was healthy, so you'd probably guess (correctly) that this image also contains healthy
	  tissue.  Is it possible to train a computer to identify these features, and
	  why is this important?

	  <h2> Histology is repetitive </h2>
	  Histology is the study of the microscopic structure of
	  tissue.  It is often used to accurately diagnose cancer and other diseases, and is an essential tool
	  for researchers evaluating new potential cures for these diseases.  There are many steps involved in preparing
	  a histological slide before it can be examined by a histopathologist -- fixing, processing, embedding,
	  sectioning, and staining. <br><br>
	  The automation of these steps has already been solved by
	  a company called HistoWiz that offers automated histology for biomedical researchers, where tissue samples can
	  be processed in as little as
	  3-days.  HistoWiz returns a DZI (Deep Zoom Image) file to these researchers, allowing them to zoom in up to 40x
	  and resolve tissue features on the micron level.<br><br>  It can take a considerable amount of time for researchers
	  to pour over these images and identify regions of interest.  A computer trained to identify these regions would
	  save researchers substantial time and effort, enabling them to accelerate their groundbreaking research.  Companies
	  that offer this service would be the go-to for these researchers, so investment in these techniques is a worthwhile pursuit.
	  
	  <h2> How do we train a computer </h2>
	  There are two steps involved in training a computer to classify images.  First, we need to use algorithms to identify key
	  features within the images that are able to discriminate between our different categories.  The algorithms that quantify the
	  structure and color of an image fall into the category of computer vision.  <br> <br>
	  Once we've decided on a set a features which we think may have discriminating power between different categories of images, we
	  can use these features as inputs to a classifier.  There are many different classifiers to choose from, but they generally fall
	  into one of two categories : supervised learning and unsupervised learning.  If we have a set of images that has already been
	  labeled, and we want to train a computer to recoginize future images that belong under that label, a supervised learning algorithm
	  would be the best choice.  If instead, we want to find unique groups within an unlabeled set of data, an unsupervised classifier would be
	  the way to go. <br> <br>
	  One last note -- there is a powerful technique called deep learning.  Given a large enough dataset, the feature identification
	  and image classification can be learned by a single machine learning algorithm.  These algorithms require enormously large
	  training datasets to achieve accurate classifications,
	  but once trained, they can be efficiently repurposed for different applications using a technique called transfer learning.

	  <!--
	  <h3> Computer vision </h3>
	  Structual features may involve the size and relative location of various shapes (e.g. lines,
	  edges, circles, etc.), wheras color properties look at both the absolute color and the amount of color variation in an image.
	  Some of these features may be more or less useful depending on the application.  For example, the absolute color may not be
	  useful in identifing cars, which come in a variety of colors, wheras stop signs could be identified by looking for octogonal
	  patches of red.  <br>

	  <h3> Training a classifier </h3>
	  <h3> Deep learning </h3>
	  -->
	  
	  <h2> The data </h2>
	  The data I am working with are composed of 6732 individual tissue slide frame images, equally split between tissue
	  classified as normal and tissue classified as metastatic.  Each frame measure 224x224 pixels, and I used a 60/20/20
	  split to divide that data between my train, cross-validation, and test sets.  Some fraction of the images contain very
	  little tissue (i.e. greater than 95% of the slide is white background).  I excluded these slides from my training, cross-validation, and test
	  sets, leaving 6611 total slides to work with.  3962 of these are use for training, 1325 are used for cross-validation,
	  and the remaining 1324 are reserved for testing.  After visually inspecting both the normal
	  and the metastatic tissue images in my training set, I engineered the following computer vision features: blob density,
	  tissue discontinuity, and color compactness.
	  <h3> Blob density </h3>
	  <img src="../images/normal_blobs.jpeg" width="25%" style="float:right;"/>
	  As a particle physicist by training, I noticed that the healthy tissue contains a greater density of "blobs" than
	  the metastatic tissue (I have since learned that these blobs are healthy cell nuclei).
	  I employed a blob finding algorithm using openCV, which
	  searches each image for groups of connected pixels that share a common property.  The parameters of these algorithms
	  can be tuned to search for blobs of different shapes and sizes.  In the image on the right, the yellow circles indicate
	  where a blob has been found.  Because I set up my blob finder to find circular blobs, it misses overlapping nuclei that
	  appear as a single, elongated blob (e.g. look at the right-middle of the image).
	  <h3> Color compactness </h3>
	  <img src="../images/metastatic_cc.jpeg" width="25%" style="float:right;"/>
	  Color compactness is a measure of the color variability in an image.  A k-means clustering
	  algorithm is used to cluster the pixels in an image into a specified number of classes (k), such
	  that the sum of the distances (in color space) of each pixel from its assigned cluster center is
	  minimized.  This sum (with an addition normalization) is used as the color compactness metric.
	  In other words, color compactness is measure of how well an image can be represented using k colors.  The
	  color compactness measure for this project uses k=3.  This is motivated by the H&E stain used in these slides,
	  which generally produces dichromatic images (k=3 is used because there is often some white space in an image).
	  The image on the right shows the color compacted image of a slide containing metastatic tissue.
	  <h3> Tissue discontinuity </h3>
	  <img src="../images/normal_td.jpeg" width="25%" style="float:right;"/>
	  Tissue discontinuity is a measure of the connectedness of tissue in a given slide.  Tissue that is very connected will have
	  a low tissue discontinuity score, and vice-versa for disconnected tissue.  This feature is computed by converting the image to
	  a black-white representation of itself, and then using an edge detection algorithm to find the boundaries between black and white.
	  Tissue that is not very connected tends to have many small patches of white space, and therefore more edges per unit area of white
	  space (than connected tissue).  In the image on the right, the small colored circles show where the algorithm has detected an edge.  
	  <h3> Absolute color </h3>
	  It can be easy to get excited about computer vision techniques and ignore more basic features that have discrimination
	  power between different types of tissue.  The individual R,G,B pixel intensities, averaged
	  over the images as a whole, are very powerful in discriminating between normal and metastatic tissue.
	  <h2> Feature distributions </h2>
	  The plots below show the distributions of these features for the normal and metastatic tissue in the training set.
	  The distributions are normalized to unit area, so for each bin on the horizontal axis, the vertical axis represents the
	  fraction of training set data in that particular bin.
	  <div style="background-color:white;">
	  <img src="../images/blobs.jpg" width="49%"/> <img src="../images/color_compactness.jpg" width="49%"/> <img src="../images/tissue_discontinuity.jpg" width="49%"/>
	  <img src="../images/avg_blue.jpg" width="49%"/> <img src="../images/avg_red.jpg" width="49%"/> <img src="../images/avg_green.jpg" width="49%"/>
	  </div>
	  <br>
	  The color compactness and tissue discontinuity features are peaked near zero and difficult to visualize,
	  so I performed a log-transformation to improve the interpretability of these features within the context of the models I
	  have trained (I added a bias value of 0.1*min(feature) to accomodate feature values equal to 0).  These two log-transformed features
	  are shown below.
	  <div style="background-color:white;">
	    <img src="../images/color_compactness_logtr.png" width="49%"/> <img src="../images/tissue_discontinuity_logtr.jpg" width="49%"/>
	  </div>
	  
	  <h2> The models </h2>
	  <h3> Logistic regression </h3>
	  Many of the feature disributions above show excellent separation between the normal and metastatic tissue (e.g. blob density
	  and the average R/G/B across all pixels).  Based on these distributions, I would expect a linear model, such as logistic
	  regression, to perform reasonably well.  I trained scikit-learn's LogisticRegression classifier with its default parameters
	  on the 3962 slides in my training set.  This classifier achieves 92.5% accuracy, evaluated on the cross-validation set.  Of
	  the 99 misclassified slides, 51 are metastatic tissue misclassified as normal and 48 are normal tissue misclassified as
	  metastatic.  In a logistic regression model, the magnitude of the learned feature coefficients give the relative importance
	  of each respective feature.  The ranking from the most to the least important feature is:
	  <ul>
	    <li> Average Pixel Red </li>
	    <li> Average Pixel Green </li>
	    <li> Tissue Discontinuity </li>
	    <li> Average Pixel Blue </li>
	    <li> Color Compactness </li>
	    <li> Blob Density </li>
	  </ul>
	  <br>
	  At first glance, it is maybe a bit surprising that the blob density ranks so low in feature importance.  The blobs density
	  distributions for normal and metastatic tissue look very separated.  However, the blob density is highly (anti-)correlated with
	  all three average pixel colors, as can be seen in the correlation matrix below.
	  <img src="../images/correlation_matrix.jpg" width="100%"/>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <h3> Neural net </h3>
	  Logistic regression models have a linear decision boundary.  If the tissue and metastatic tissue slides are not linearly
	  separable, it may be advantageous to move to a non-linear classifier, such as a neural network.  I used the Multi-layer
	  Perceptron (MLP) classifier in scikit-learn.  For this model, it is possible (and advised) to specify the number and size
	  of the hidden layers.  I iterated over models with one hidden layer of size k1={2,...,11}.  The optimal cross-validation
	  acuracy was found to be 97.2% for k1=6.  By fixing k1=6 and adding a second hidden layer(again iterating over the size of
	  the second hidden layer), the cross-validation accuracy had minimal improvement to 97.4% for a second hidden layer size of
	  k2=5.  Overall, the neural net classifier performs modestly better than the logistic regression classifer, due to the non-linear
	  decision boundary.
	  
	  <h2> What about deep learning? </h2>
	  Deep learning is a technique in which multiple layers of nonlinear processing units are used to derive high level abstractions of
	  data.  These methods require an enourmous collection of data and a signficant amount of computing capabilities, only found at
	  prominent tech companies and research labs.  Inception-v3 is a convolutional neural network, trained on 1 million images across
	  1000 individual categories, to perform image recognition and categorization.
	  <h3> Can <b><u>I</u></b> do deep learning? </h3>
	  Although it is not feasible for most individuals to train a network like Inception-v3 from scratch,
	  pre-trained networks can be re-purposed to perform new tasks using a method called transfer learning.  The motivation for
	  transfer learning comes from the fact that most layers in these networks are not performing the classification, but instead, deriving
	  abstract features on which to perform a classification task.  The bulk of the classification task happens in the last layer.
	  Therefore, we can simply "chop off" this last layer, and use the output features from the second-to-last layer as inputs
	  to a new classifier.
	  <h3> Transfer learning for tissue classification </h3>
	  For the Inception-v3 network in particular, the relevant output layer for transfer learning is called "pool_3" and produces
	  2048 features which can be passed to logistic regression or MLP classifier.  I passed my collection of slide frames through the
	  Inception-v3 neural network and extracted this pool_3 feature vector for each image.  Due to the large size of these feature vectors,
	  it is useful to perform a principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data.  The left figure below shows the
	  cross-validation accuracy of a logisitic regeression classifier, as a function of the number of principal components.  The red horizontal
	  line near the top of the figure is used to reference the accuracy of MLP classifier trained on the six features derived using computer
	  vision techniques.  The right figure below shows the % of variance as a function of the number of principal components.  It is a measure
	  of how well the dimensionality reduction captures the complexity of its original dataset.
	  <br> <br>
	  <div style="background-color:white; text-align:center;">
	  <img src="../images/IncAccVSnPCA.jpg" width="49%"/> <img src="../images/var_retained.jpg" width="49%"/>
	  </div>
	  <h3> The performance looks similar </h3>
	  Yes, both models have a classification accuracy of ~97% on the cross-validation sample.  This might lead one to wonder if there are
	  certain advantages to either approach.  The transfer learning method has the advantage that it <em> did not require any feature
	  engineering </em>!  This approach is required for image recognition tasks where it can be hard (if not impossible) to define
	  general features for image classification (i.e. recognizing most everything objects that come in many shape, colors, and sizes).
	  For our tissue classification task, many of the features are well suited for computer vision algorithms.  Still, starting from
	  the Inception-v3 network could have saved a day or two of manual feature engineering.  
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  One of the potential drawbacks of the transfer learning method is the large number of features required to achieve the same
	  cross-validation accuracy as the method using hand crafted computer vision features.  It is possible that the larger number
	  of features requires more training examples to achieve the same accuracy.  This can be investigated by selecting different
	  size subsets of the training data for training the classifiers.  The results of this exercise are shown below.
	  <br>
	  <div style="background-color:white;">
	    <img src="../images/nTrainTurnOn.jpg" width="49%"/> <img src="../images/nTurnOnAss.jpg" width="49%"/>
	  </div>
	  <br>
	  The size of the training set is varied from m=1 to m=3962 (the total number of training examples).
	  For each m, both a model based on the six computer vision features
	  and a model based on the transfer learning features are trained using those m examples, and the accuracy is evaluated on the
	  cross-validation sample.  For the transfer learning method, because the number of principal components cannot be larger than
	  the number of training examples or the number of features, min(m, no. features) is chosen to the number of principal components.
	  The left plot above shows the turn on region (m < 20) and the right plot shows the asymptotic behavior.
							    <br> <br>
	  <h3> Conclusion </h3>
          Neither approach shows a clear advantage in the number of training examples required to achieve a high cross-validation
	  classification accuracy.  The human engineering computer vision features are attractive because they can be easily communicated
	  to a pathologist.  The transfer learning approach is nice because it requires less input on the human-side of things, and can
	  be more easily generalized to new classification problems.  Both approaches give very nice results and should give pathologists
	  hope that we can eliminate some reptetitiveness from their work!

	  <h2> What's next </h2>
	  This work is largely a proof-of-concept.  In a real world examples, whole slide images are composed of composed of thousands of
	  individual slide frames and can contain a wide variety of different looking tissue.  Unless we can construct a training set with a
	  sufficient number of each of these types of tissue, we will need to resort to unsupervised learning approaches.  One could imagine a heat
	  map indicating the location of each of the unique types of tissue on a slide, with a key showing a representative slide frame from each
	  of those  groupings.  The work presented in this blog gives evidence that with a bit more work,
	  these sorts of applications are very possible!
